    Duration
        not sure what unit is best - probably days
            Maybe a key to turn this off to make it instant? Both for testing purposes and because some of the below (if doable) would be nice additions to stock science behaviour
    Resource consumption
        (Have discussed what a headache this could be, not a total nightmare to lose it)
    Crew
        Number of crew
            Minimum crew skill level/profession
            Maybe whether crew need to be on the specific part or just on the vessel?
                Stock can do this through internal situation masks I believe but can only test for having crew on a part, not how many, and only whether a kerbal is a scientist, not other skills & not what level they are
    Specific item in inventory (stock EVA experiment can already do this)
        Consume item on start of experiment?
    Most of the stock module settings would be nice to have, but especially:
        External situation masks/requirements (space low/high etc)
            Animation to play at start (and reverse at end)
                Use case for this is I want to have a little tray come out on airlock door to expose a sample to space (with the sample visual depending on what you have in your part inventory)
            Whether you can grab data on EVA
            Whether you activate the experiment on EVA
            Transmit penalty
            Whether experiment needs to be cleaned to be used again & if that takes a resource (stock mystery goo etc. do this)
